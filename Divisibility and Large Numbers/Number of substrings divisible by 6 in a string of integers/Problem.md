# Number of substrings divisible by 6 in a string of integers

Given a string consisting of integers 0 to 9. The task is to count the number of substrings which when convert into integer are divisible by 6. Substring does not contain leading zeroes.

Examples:

    Input : s = "606".
    Output : 5
    Substrings "6", "0", "6", "60", "606"
    are divisible by 6.

    Input : s = "4806".
    Output : 5
    "0", "6", "48", "480", "4806" are 
    substring which are divisible by 6.
